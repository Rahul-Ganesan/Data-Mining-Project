# Navigating through the Colorado Housing Crisis - An Analysis of Colorado Housing Data

by Rahul Ganesan and Moukthika Guanpaneedu

Colorado is currently facing housing crisis, due to various factors such as seasonal tourism, investment properties, and the rise of short-term rentals leading to increasing vacancy rate.  In case of resorts, the vacancy rate soars due to part-time residents and vacation homes, which makes finding affordable housing difficult for fulltime residents and workers. This problem has worsened as investors continue to dominate housing market, pushing prices higher and pricing out locals.

Lack of affordable housing is a major concern, especially for lower earning residents. Around 150,000 households are struggling, since they spend more than 50 percent of their earning on housing.  This strains many families financially, forcing them to cut back on basic essentials like food and healthcare.
