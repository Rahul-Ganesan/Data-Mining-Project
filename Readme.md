# Navigating through the Colorado Housing Crisis - An Analysis of Colorado Housing Data

by Rahul Ganesan and Moukthika Gunapaneedu

Colorado is currently facing housing crisis, due to various factors such as seasonal tourism, investment properties, and the rise of short-term rentals leading to increasing vacancy rate.  In case of resorts, the vacancy rate soars due to part-time residents and vacation homes, which makes finding affordable housing difficult for fulltime residents and workers. This problem has worsened as investors continue to dominate housing market, pushing prices higher and pricing out locals. Lack of affordable housing is a major concern, especially for lower earning residents. Around 150,000 households are struggling, since they spend more than 50 percent of their earning on housing.  This strains many families financially, forcing them to cut back on basic essentials like food and healthcare.

The mission of this project is to analyze population and housing trends at the municipal level, with the goal of identifying patterns and gaps in housing availability, occupancy rates, and demographic shifts. By leveraging data on population size, household composition, and housing units, the project aims to provide actionable insights for policymakers, urban planners, and community stakeholders. This analysis will contribute to more informed decision-making in addressing housing shortages, improving urban development strategies, and ensuring equitable access to housing across regions.

# Milestone 2:

Dataset : https://demography.dola.colorado.gov/assets/html/housing.html

We've used the Municipal Population and Housing Timeseries Data from 2010 to Current Year (2024 at this time of project). This dataset contains around 4600 entries, comprising of population and housing details across various counties in Colorado.

We have cleaned and performed data preprocessing for this data, with added insights using graphical visualization methods. Please refer to Milestone2.ipynb for the corresponding code for this analysis.
